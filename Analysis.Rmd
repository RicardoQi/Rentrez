This analysis focuses on the topic of Lyme Disease and Borrelia burgdorferi. This script provides analysis for former R codes, and makes statistical comparison between data.\n

## Steps
First, the csv file is imported.
```{r}
Sequences <- read.csv("Sequences.csv")
```
Then, each sequence is separated and printed
```{r}
r1 <- Sequences$Sequence[1]
print(r1)
r2 <- Sequences$Sequence[2]
print(r2)
r3 <- Sequences$Sequence[3]
print(r3)
```
The tables that count for the amount of ATCG of each sequence are provided.
```{r}
table(strsplit(r1, "")[[1]])
table(strsplit(r2, "")[[1]])
table(strsplit(r3, "")[[1]])
```
Next, the GC contents of each sequence are calculated.
```{r}
library(stringr)
id <- sub("(^.)", "\\1.", Sequences$Name)
id1 <- word(id, 1, sep = fixed(' '))

num_c1 <- str_count(r1, "C")
num_g1 <- str_count(r1, "G")
gc1 <- (num_g1 + num_c1) / str_length(r1) * 100 

num_c2 <- str_count(r2, "C")
num_g2 <- str_count(r2, "G")
gc2 <- (num_g2 + num_c2) / str_length(r2) * 100

num_c3 <- str_count(r3, "C")
num_g3 <- str_count(r3, "G")
gc3 <- (num_g3 + num_c3) / str_length(r3) * 100 

gc <- c(gc1,gc2,gc3)
table(id1,gc)
```
